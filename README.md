# GlassBox:
GlassBox at MIT PolicyHackathon April-2019. Bringing transparency and auditability to recidivism risk-assessment and parole/pre-trial decision-making process.


# Inspiration:
Making AI more interpretable and transparent to the judges while adjudicating criminal cases. Currently available recidivism assessment tools (e.g. Compas) provides black-box recommendations
to judges.



# Built With:
<ul>
<li>Scikit-learn</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Python v3.6</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>HTML 5</li>
<li>CSS 3</li>
</ul>

## Description:
<ul>
<li>Software transparency</li>

Recidivism risk-assessment software must provide statistically significant score followed by a list of contributing factors, allowing judges to tweak the inputs to influence the score

<li>Decision-making process auditability</li>

Changes to original score must be justified by the judges, subject to appeal courtâ€™s audit

</ul>

## What it does:
<ul>
<li> Displays the likelihood of recidivism (in %) </li>
<li> Offers the choice to pull out Top-K(1<=K<=30) factors that contribute to the likelihood of recidivism score </li>
<li> Allows toggling amongst all of the factors to see the score deviation </li>
</ul>


## What's next for Glass-Box:
<ul>
	<li>Training Glass-Box to surpass Compas accuracy</li>
	<li>Providing statistics and benchmarks to judges(individual trajectory, benchmark with state national level)</li>
</ul>
